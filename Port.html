                  <p> I created a responsive stopwatch application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features essential functionalities: it allows users to start, pause, and reset the stopwatch, and also to record lap times. The "Start/Pause" button toggles between starting and pausing the stopwatch, while the "Reset" button clears the timer and all recorded lap times. The "Lap" button records each lap, displaying them in a list below the main timer. The design is both clean and responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices. HTML provides the structure, CSS enhances the visual appeal and responsiveness, and JavaScript drives the interactive features, such as real-time updates and timing calculations. This combination results in a functional and user-friendly stopwatch that is ideal for performance tracking and timekeeping tasks.</p>
